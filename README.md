# SummonerStats
# Work in Progress

The Summoner Stats website allows you to search for a League of Legends player and it displays a profile page for them including information about previous games played, ranking, most played champions and more.

This project is built on the ASP.NET framework, following MVC design. Data is pulled from the Riot Games REST API (JSON).
